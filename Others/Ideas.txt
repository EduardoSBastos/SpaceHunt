  - In godot, each state can be a Node that gets called by a parten FSM Node
  - Player states:

	- Dead 
	  - What heppends when player dies?
		- Movement stops OK
		- Sprite invisible OK
		- Teleport to spawn position
		- Revive
		  - Sprite visible
		  - Regain controls
	- I just wrote a bunch of code to do the same as deleting the player!

> Player State Machine
  - Each state of the machine sends signals on execution, enter and exit state.
	- Nodes respond to these signals.
	  - Some nodes toggle their "active" state based on which state was 
		transitioned into.

 - It bothers me that the sender of the signal knows who to send the signal to.
   - Connecting trough code solves the issue
	 - Even tough it means more code.
